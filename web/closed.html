      <h1>Looking for Scenic Or Not?</h1>
      <p>ScenicOrNot was a mySociety project running from 2009 to 2015, created
      with help from our friends at The Dextrous Web. Users were served a
      series of images from around the country, and invited to rate them on a
      scale of 1-10.</p>

        <p>The result of this game was a crowd-sourced database, giving an
        aggregate ‘scenicness’ rating for every square kilometre of Great
        Britain.</p>

        <p>ScenicOrNot helped to prove the concept of crowd-sourcing, and the
        idea that, if you make a task compelling enough, people will flock to
        contribute – a concept now commonly called ‘gamification’. We believe
        it was, at the time, unprecedented as a piece of crowd-sourced geodata
        about a whole country.</p>

        <p>The <a href="/faq">data</a> and <a
            href="/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> are still available for anyone
        who wants them. They were originally generated primarily for our own
        project Mapumental, which helps people find places to live based on
        public transport times and other important considerations, such as the
        beauty of the surroundings.</p>

        <h2>Why have we closed this site?</h2>

        <p>ScenicOrNot was one of several useful, open source sites conceived
        and run by mySociety, <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/projects/">many
            of which</a> continue to flourish. In 2015, with
        regret, we made the tough decision to turn our focus to running our
        core sites and providing support to international partners.

        <h2>Would you like to run ScenicOrNot yourself?</h2>
        <p>We believe there may still be a need for a site like ScenicOrNot. If
        you’re at all interested in taking it over and running it, <a
            href="https://www.mysociety.org/contact/">get in touch</a> and
        we’ll tell you what’s involved.</p>
